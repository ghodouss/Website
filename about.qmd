This is my website. Most of the content here is centered around my opinions around computing, Bayesian modeling, local events in Santa Barbara and the many discrepencies I see between claims and reality in the tech industry. I tend to publish my more rigorous analyses at my company's [blog](https://blog.sturdystatistics.com) and [website](https:sturdystatistics.com).

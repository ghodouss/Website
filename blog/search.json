    "text": "TLDR: Why I’m Excited\nCurrent scRNA pipelines rely on a heuristic driven 2-step process. First some form of filtering+dimensionality reduction, followed by a clustering step, followed by either manual labeling of these clusters or a classification model to learn/apply annotation to this data.\nOur technology can model this entire pipeline in as a single unified joint probabilty distribution with 3 branches. We have a topic branch that learns a probability distribution across genes for each topic, a cell branch that learns a probabilty distribution across topics for each cell, and a classification branch that learns regression weights for each cell’s topic distribution.\nThis is powerful because our topics are jointly modeling both the unsupervised co-occurance information along with any annotations provided. This structure enables not only robust, few-shot classification but also extremely granular explainability."

    "text": "First Experiment\nWe took an already annotated dataset that Ramiz was extremely familiar with to evaluate (1) whether our model was capable to learning the annotations and (2) whether the genes that comprised the predictive topics lined up with Ramiz’s extensive manual annotation process.\nThe model actually worked better than I could have hoped. We trained the model on 150 labels for 12 different cell types. We then evaluated the model on 2000 held out datapoints. Our model mislabelled only 3/2000 examples in the test set. We didn’t dig too deep into the model performance beyond that, since this was more just a validation experiement.\nWhat I was really excited to dig into was the explanatory analysis. Our model uses a error-tolerant variant of the sparsity-inducing Finish Horseshoe prior that we call the Santa Barbara Horseshoe. This prior enables our model, with only a few examples, to confidently separate meaningful parameters from noisy ones.\n  \n\nFigure 1: Predictive weight of all topics to the corresponding cell type prediction with the three closely related conical cell types. Any topic not shown was strongly consistent with 0 or no predictive importance. Notice that any topic that is strongly predictive for one classs is strongly negative for the other. Our model is able to split out three distinct topic groups within even closely related cell types because of our ability to jointly model topics with labels.\n\nWhat’s really cool is now for any of the predictive topics, we can dig into the genes that comprise it:\n\nTopic 49: Predictive of Rod\n['Sag', 'Gngt1', 'Rho', 'mt-Atp6', 'Pdc', 'Mir124-2hg', 'Prph2',\n'mt-Co2', 'Unc119', 'Pde6g', 'Tma7', 'Rom1', 'Ubb', 'Nr2e3',\n'Rpl26', 'Hsp90aa1', 'H3f3b', 'mt-Cytb', 'Gapdh', 'H3f3a',\n'Rpgrip1', 'Pkm', 'Rp1', 'mt-Co3', 'Gnb1', 'mt-Co1', 'Ckb']\nThese genes line up really exactly with Ramiz’s manual annotation. The difference was that this pipeline was fully automatic."

    "text": "Next Steps\nWhile I believe there is a lot of value to the explainble components of this model, we are going to focus on classification because it is much easier to quantitatively evaluate and can also solve a real pain point for the scRNA research community. I described the current painstaking process of annotating scRNA sequences that is extremely manual, heuristic, and time consuming. The reason for this current process is current classification methods do not generalize across experiments: batch effects throw off normal statistics based classification and clustering models.\nOur model provides a number of avenues to handle batch effects. Our hope is that it works out of the box, but we also have hierarchical levers we can pull to factor batch effects directly into our model structure. We plan to take 35 annotated datasets of mouse eye scRNA sequences, train our model on one of them, and evaluate it’s performance on the other 34. Our model’s performancew ill determine the next steps from there, but I’m extremely excited and optimistic based on our initial set of results."

    "section": "Two Examples",
    "text": "Two Examples\n\nEnd to end customer support automation.\nLet’s assume LLMs never hallucinate and follow instructions perfectly. They will follow the high level instructions and think reasonably within the bounds of your parameters. We are running a contact center for a telecom company and we want to deploy AI agents to automate our customer support. As an executive, this is a dream come true: I can simply describe what I want at a high level, have an engineer encode this into an agent, and I now have an army of customer support agents doing exactly what I told them to do.\nAnd that’s a problem.\nI worked as a data scientist in the contact center industry for several years. I never once met an executive who actually understood what was happening on their phone calls. Contact centers function not because of their executive leadership, but in spite of it. Agents handle such a broad set of issues and queries that never propagate up to upper management. How would an AI agent handle credit locks? Arbitrary requests about whether NASCAR is included in their cable package? If Fiber is supported at their address?\nAll of these issues are solvable, but they require (1) the company to catch up with them as they appear and (2) the information to disseminate to the top level stakeholder. (1) loses the company money until (2) happens. And proper information dissemination is the largest unsolved in modern companies.\nThe cream cheese can fill the hole: costs go down, contact centers look fine. But now customers abuse the chatbot and so security costs go up. Revenue is dropping due to unexpected support and checkout issues. Customers churn to competitors. Observability and infrastructure costs go up. A functional organization held together by humans is now spending more money to “automate” their system.\n\n\nLarge Scale Text Data Analysis\nThe naive approach is to flood an LLM’s context window with as many documents as you can and ask it for an analysis or to answer a question of some kind. It’ll write up some plausible enough report. GPT can automate the first step of analysis: but the process of doing that first step as a human provides the framework for the actual meat of the analysis: the iterative process of learning, exploring, and digging.\nThere are ways you can improve the quality of the report. You can use the LLM to first organize excerpts and documents into categories, building a database to store and query these, feeding this structure recursively into an LLM. You can even put in some work to explore this structure yourself. But in this process you are again adding a layer of unreliability and obfuscation between you and the data, you are investing time into a process that is not building your domain knowledge. You are instead being steered not toward the crucial unknown unknown, but rather to the report that looks the most probable to the LLM.\nThe cream cheese fills the hole: LLMs are able to write reports that look human almost instantly. But analysts who were previously digging into the contents of data, accumulating domain knowledge are now spending their time prompting, tinkering, and churning out professionally written, insight-free reports."

    "text": "Companies Need Caulk to Harden\nMy point here is not that LLMs are useless. Instead it’s that the applications that are the best fit for LLMs do not drive as much value as you expect because there is inherent value in the process of a human performing the task.\nThat value might be in the adaptability of a human contact center agent to handle the never ending long-tail of edge cases, or the willingness to break from guidelines when common sense dictates. It may be in the process of an analyst accumulating a broad swath of domain knowledge by manually digging through raw data that provides broader contexts to any insights and builds over time. It may be from a software engineer needing to actually read through the documentation of a core library in their production stack and eventually using that knowledge to make a tangential design decision.\nQuantitative metrics will not capture the loss of these processes immediately. The cheese fills the hole and over the long term will decay. It’s much easier to just do the job correctly the first time."

I started by using it for data visualization and it one-shot converted my descriptions to the exact visuals in my mind. I then was dealing with a chunking edge case and it also solved it perfectly.\nOnly two days in and I found myself pulled towards a prompt every time I needed to think through a problem. It was addicting in a way that I’ve only ever experienced with gambling (with which I had a similarly brief foray). I soon found myself going back and forth, trying again and again to one-shot a more complex feature, going back and forth between the output and prompt specifications. I then closed the language model, spent 10 minutes of focused effort and built exactly what I needed.\nProgramming languages allow you to break down problems into multiple levels of hierarchy and abstraction. For me personally, even if I think through the approach, I only discover this structure after my first pass at a solution. I often tend to throw away my first solution and rewrite from scratch. Coding with LLMs for anything non-trivial hides this internal learning: I was instead operating at an input/output level.\nIf code is building blocks, LLMs can operate very well at the single block level. However, it’s not always obvious to me whether my current task is a single building block or a collection of them. Combined with the dopamine hit from successful one shot solutions and it was easy for me to turn the my slow and steady software engineering into a game of slots. Some huge wins but a net loss.\nI’m sure a more discerning engineer could have a better intuition for the best time to hand off items to an LLM. But for me, I had to make a hard rule for myself that I won’t ever copy/paste LLM code to any of my work projects."

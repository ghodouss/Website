So I got blocked by reddit at a network level.
Every so often and more and more I search for X reviews reddit.
Despite all the astroturfing it's a hard habbit to break.


Fortunately for me Reddit wanted to point me in a better direction.
My phone with my primary browser are now blocked.

I really dont do anything too weird on my phone.
I look up things every so often.
I use safari with DuckDuckGo and some adblockers and icloud private relay.

I get similar treatment with my laptop.
People who I work with or friends are stunned at how many Captchas I get.
I might be missing something but it feels like we are moving in a direction
in which if you make the minimum effort to preserve your online privacy,
you are slowly being more and more blackballed.

Maybe this is the result of the damage inflicted bu AI scrapers in this gold rush bubble.
Moving digital archives locally is on the todo list.
Mildly concerned for the future of the internet.

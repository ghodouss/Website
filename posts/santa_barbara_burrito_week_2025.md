title: Santa Barbara Burrito Week Prospective Itinerary 
date: 2025-09-20
---

This is the set of restaurants for which I am the most personally excited about during [Santa Barbara burrito week](https://www.independent.com/2025/09/17/roll-em-up-chow-em-down-its-burrito-week-2025/). 
This list factors in *variety, convenience, and excitement.*
I will update this list as I eat. 
I may even get *crazy* and visit a place not on this list. 
I will keep you posted.

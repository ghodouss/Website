This is the set of restaurants for which I am the most personally excited about during [Santa Barbara sandwich week](https://www.independent.com/2025/06/25/santa-barbaras-first-ever-sandwich-week). 
This list factors in *variety, convenience, and excitement.*
I will update this list as I eat. 
I may even get *crazy* and visit a place not on this list. 
I will keep you posted.
